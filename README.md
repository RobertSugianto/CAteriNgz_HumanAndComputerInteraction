# Foreword
This repository contains my individual work on my college Human and Computer Interaction lab project. This project was about making a website for a large scale food vendor for wedding, birthday, and any other large events. This website was created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript and need to have exact same page and component that are requested by the rule.
